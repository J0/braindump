# Hi! {#hi}

I'm [Joel](https://www.ajoellee.com/), and you've chanced upon my braindump.
This website contains my working notes accumulated over some years. I forked this from 
[Jethro Kuan's braindump](braindump.jethro.dev) and I'm repurposing it from my own needs.


I also haven't made good entry-points to my brain yet, but you can start hopping
around by going to the [full index](/posts/).

Have fun!
